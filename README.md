Add a `config.py` file to hold:
- standard constructor arguments
- method test arguments
- expected outputs
- class names
- point values  
etc.   

See gpt for more info

I think there might be an issue:
- if constructor fails, then calling the method may be calling the fallback, but want it to use the method from the 
class with the broken __init__
